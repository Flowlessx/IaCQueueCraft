## Key Components

1. **Backend Service:** The core of the application, providing RESTful APIs and managing task processing logic.
   
2. **Worker Service:** Responsible for executing background tasks asynchronously using Redis Queue (RQ).
   
3. **Frontend Service:** Offers a user-friendly interface for interacting with the application, enabling users to submit tasks, monitor their status, and retrieve results.
   
4. **Redis Service:** Acts as the central message broker and caching layer for task queueing and result storage.
   
5. **rq-dashboard Service:** Provides a visual dashboard for monitoring RQ queues, workers, and tasks in real-time.
   
6. **Scaler Service:** Implements auto-scaling capabilities to dynamically adjust the number of service instances based on workload demand.
   
7. **GitLab and GitLab Runner Services:** Enable version control, continuous integration, and continuous deployment (CI/CD) for the application codebase.
